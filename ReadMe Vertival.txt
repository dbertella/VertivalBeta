VERTIVAL WordPress Theme


Vertival has a 7 slide templates:

- Cover slide (title + introduction + )
- Focus slide (one important phrase)
- Description slide (text + picture)
- List slide (a classic bullet list)
- Photo List (a single picture)
- Moodboard slide (4 pictures)
- Video slide (an embedded video)

When you create a slide, pay attention to use only one single template. If you write content in more than one template, only the first will be displayed.

To set an image as background use the "featured image" option in the backend.(800x600 is enough!)

Some template like the Focus, the List and the Description, have an animation applied to the text.
If you want to modify theese animations you have to open the index.php file and change the class applied to their DIV.
For example, this is the way the DIV is animated with a fly in from the left: class="animate-in" data-animation="fly-in-left".
This is the way the DIV is animated with a fly in from the right: class="animate-in" data-animation="fly-in-right".



To change the apparence of the slide you can work on the style.css file, be aware it could compromise the responsive property of the template.



The slide you create are showed according to the number ID (alphabetical order). This mean that you have to insert the number ID in each slide you create: from the ID 01 to the ID 99, if you create 99 slides.
